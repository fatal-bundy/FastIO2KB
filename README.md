# FastIO2KB

This repository contains source code for a Windows console application, `fast2kb.exe`, which reads input via `iDmacDrv32.dll` or `iDmacDrv64.dll` from a Fast I/O Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC) and remaps this input to DirectInput keyboard events. Any DirectInput-compatible application can receive the remapped input.

For example, on a Windows-based arcade machine with a Fast I/O control system, `fast2kb.exe` can serve input to a DirectInput-compatible emulator such as MAME or PPSSPP.

## System Requirements

* **Operating system:** Windows XP or later. Tested successfully with:
  * Windows XP Embedded SP2
  * Windows 10 Pro, 32-bit
  * Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit
* **Fast I/O DMAC board and drivers**: Tested successfully with:
  * Taito Type X<sup>2</sup> PCIe board (K91X1209A J9100636A). This device is manufactured by Oki Information Systems and is found in NESiCAxLive and Dariusburst versions of Taito Type X<sup>2</sup> arcade machines. Device Manager was used to install a driver package containing `oem1.inf`, `iDmacDrv32.sys`, and `iDmacDrv32.dll`, all pulled from a working system.
  * Taito Type X<sup>3</sup> PCIe board (K91X1217C J9100638A) + connector board (K92X0281C J9200167C). This device is manufactured by Oki Information Systems and is found in Taito Type X<sup>3</sup> arcade machines. Device Manager was used to install a driver package containing `idmacdrv64.inf`, `iDmacDrv64.sys`, and `iDmacDrv64.dll`, `iDmacDrv64.cat`, and `idmacdrv64.PNF`, all pulled from a working system.
* **Fast I/O microcontroller board**: Taito boards with the designation J9100634A (having a JAMMA edge) or J9100633A (not having a JAMMA edge) are believed to be compatible. Tested successfully with:
  * Taito K91X1204A J9100634A board. Works. Thanks, Murray, for the report.
  * Taito K91X1204B J9100634A board. Testing included inputs on JAMMA edge, as well as Button 6–8 inputs on 14-pin JST NH header (labelled "B"). All work.
  * Taito K91X1202A J9100633A board. Testing included inputs on 60-pin JST RA header (labelled "G1"). All work.
  * Taito K91X1243A J9100633A board. Testing included inputs on 60-pin JST RA header (labelled "G1"). Button 5–8 inputs do not work; others do work.

## Troubleshooting

* Depending on how your environment is configured, you might need to copy a compatible version of `iDmacDrv32.dll` or `iDmacDrv64.dll` into the same directory as `fast2kb.exe`.
* If a COM2 port is present on your system, ensure that it is either unused or connected to a JVS board. If `fast2b.exe` is able to open COM2, it assumes that COM2 is connected to a JVS board.

## Build Configurations and Keymaps

The project has different build configurations for different keymaps:

* **MAME:** This configuration works well with the default keyboard controls in MAME (an arcade machine emulator).
* **PPSSPP:** This configuration works well with the default keyboard controls in PPSSPP (a PSP emulator). Because the PSP has many inputs and just one player, the keymap combines Fast I/O's Player 1 and 2 inputs to support just one PSP player.
* **eX-BOARD and Deathsmiles II:** This configuration works well with the keyboard controls in games for the eX-BOARD arcade system. Also, it works well with the keyboard controls in Deathsmiles II (the only game for the CAVE PC arcade system).

The following tables show the keymaps from Fast I/O inputs to keyboard inputs and from keyboard inputs to emulated controls in MAME, PPSSPP, eX-BOARD games, or Deathsmiles II.

## To-do

* Test compatibility with other Fast I/O microcontroller boards, including:
  * Taito K91X1234A J9100633A board
  * Taito K91X1252A J9100633A board
* Consider adding fallback to JVS in case where Fast I/O is unavailable

## Changelog

### 2021-04-04

* Increased polling interval to 2ms (for all configurations) to filter out unwanted inputs caused by mechanical switch bounce. Thanks, Murray, for the issue report and patch.

### 2020-12-23

* Added error messages and graceful exit for cases where DLLs are missing or incompatible
* Added support for command line flag ("/?" or "/h") to show build info

### 2020-12-21

* Refactored and optimized model of button states
* Corrected log messages about Player 2&4 Button 5 release

### 2020-12-14

* Optimized cases where none of button states have changed

### 2020-10-25

* Added keymap and build configuration for eX-BOARD, as well as Deathsmiles II (one keymap and build configuration for both). Polling is attempted at submillisecond interval (nominally, 0ms) with 0.5ms precision.

### 2020-07-27

* Added 64-bit project configurations that use 64-bit drivers

### 2020-07-12

* Added support for submillisecond timings:
  * MAME configuration: Try polling at submillisecond interval (nominally, 0ms) with 0.5ms precision
  * PPSSPP configuration: Try polling at 1ms interval with 0.5ms precision. (PPSSPP's menu screens cannot handle input at submillisecond interval.)

### 2020-07-11

* Fixed undesirable power-cycling behaviour on Taito Type X<sup>2</sup> and similar systems, where a JVS board is connected to COM2. The fix entails periodically sending a JVS Reset message to COM2, to prevent timeout of the JVS board's watchdog timer. If `fastio2kb.exe` cannot open COM2 (e.g. if the system has no COM2 port or if another process already has an open connection to COM2), then `fastio2kb.exe` proceeds without COM2 communications. On the other hand, if `fastio2kb.exe` can open COM2 but COM2 is connected to some device other than a JVS board, then the connected device could malfunction due to incompatible communications.
* Clarified log messages about Fast I/O ports

### 2020-06-21

* Refactored code
* Added support for the following inputs:
  * Player 3 Start, Up, Down, Left, Right, Buttons 1–8
  * Player 4 Start, Up, Down, Left, Right, Buttons 1–8
  * Coins 3&4, Test 2, Tilt 2, Service 3&4
  * Escape 2 sequence: Player 2 Start + Button 1 + Button 3
  * Escape 3 sequence: Player 3 Start + Button 1 + Button 3
  * Escape 4 sequence: Player 4 Start + Button 1 + Button 3
* Enhanced MAME keymap to support Players 3&4
* Added early return in case where no I/O connection is detected

### 2020-06-16

* Configured project to better ensure support for Windows XP SP2
* Added request for precise timer resolution via Windows Multimedia API

### 2020-06-10

* Refactored code
* Added support for connecting Player 1&2 microcontroller board to either Port 1 or 2 of DMAC board
* Added support for extended keyboard scan codes
* Fixed bugs in mapping of Player 2 Up, Down, Left, Right
* Fixed type correctness issues

### 2020-06-08

* Added license based on zlib License, with permission from Corey Griffith ([fatal-bundy](https://github.com/fatal-bundy))

### 2020-06-07

* Forked from [fatal-bundy/KB2FastIO](https://github.com/fatal-bundy/FastIO2KB)
* Removed unused files
* Configured project to support Windows XP or later
* Configured project to use Warning Level 4 (instead of 3) for greater strictness at compile time
* Replaced keymap by adding separate build configurations for:
  * MAME keymap
  * PPSSPP keymap
* Refactored code
* Added control handler function for cleaner termination
* Shortened polling interval to 1ms (instead of 10ms)
* Fixed bugs that caused keypress (keydown) events to be reported multiple times
* Added support for the following inputs:
  * Player 1 Buttons 7&8
  * Player 2 Start, Up, Down, Left, Right, Buttons 1–8
  * Coins 1&2, Tilt, Service 2
  * Escape sequence: Player 1 Start + Button 1 + Button 3
